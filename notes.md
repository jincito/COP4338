## Unsigned Binary Integers - 32 bits

transistor
and
capacitor - high voltage = 1, low = 0

Binary is in Base 2

## Signed Binary Integers - 2's complement

The last bit is called the sign bit. If it is 1 it is negative. If 0 = pos.

### Signed representation of -1

Every bit == 0? It represents a negative 1.
